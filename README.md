In this project I analyze a publicly available dataset which is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

You can find the details about the dataset here : [Moro et al., 2011] S. Moro, R. Laureano and P. Cortez. Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology. In P. Novais et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of the European Simulation and Modelling Conference - ESM'2011, pp. 117-121, Guimar√£es, Portugal, October, 2011. EUROSIS

 The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, and oftentimes, more than one call to the same client was performed 
 to find out if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

 The goal of this project is to predict if the marketing campaign would be successfull based on the existing campaign data.
